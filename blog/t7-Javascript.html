<span style="position: relative; top: -150px;"><h2> Ruby Hashes Vs JS Objects</h2>

  <p>If we were to look at hashes in Ruby and Objects created in JavaScript, one could easily deduce that the two are virtually the same, twins of different languages if you will.  </p>
  <p>When we look at a Ruby hash, we can see that there is a key and a value pair within each element. For example Hash = {word => 1, number => 2}. We can call our word element and return the key or value.  </p>
  <p>We can do the same with JavaScript. We can create a variable object and assign it elements with values. So it would look like this: var object = {word: 1, number: 2}.  </p>
  <p>Now that we have both languages versions displayed, we can look at the differences.  First, and most obvious is that in Ruby we use => and in JS we use the colon : to separate keys and values.   </p>
  <p>We are also able to nest within Ruby hashes as well as in JS objects. The more I have been looking for differences I kept finding more similarities!   </p>
<p>One instance I have come across, and please correct me if I am wrong, is being able to access objects defined outside of the object in JS but not in Ruby. What I mean is I see some more flexibility with values in JS than with Ruby.  For instance if we want to change a value in JS we do not have to create a method to do so but simply point to it and give an elements value a new value. So if shoe{size: 10} would have to be changed to 9, we would simply write shoe.size = 9 and that would make the correct change. </p>
<p>In Ruby, we would have to create a method to do so that would search the key and value and then update the change. I Hope this makes sense! </p>
