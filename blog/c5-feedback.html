<span style="position: relative; top: -150px;"><h2> Pairing is Caring</h2>

<p>Hi and welcome to my latest installment of my DBC experience blog.  I would like to take the time to go over pairing. I will explain what exactly pairing is and how it has benefitted my learning thus far.</p>

<p>Pairing is an activity in which 2 or more people engage together to tackle a challenge. In our context this usually involves breaking down a coding problem and creating a solution. When people are pairing, they are usually doing so in prescribed roles, such as driver and navigator. Doing so helps establish a division of labor and a greater focus. Roles can and do change in sessions.</p>

<p>How is pairing you ask? I would describe it as though provoking. In my experience pairing, I have experienced different though processes of my pairs each time.  Every pairing experience so far has opened my eyes to a different way of doing things and I have loved it! I mean this in the most objective sense, because to be able to reflect on these sessions with such a sense requires a deep understanding of your own personal expectations.</p>

<p>What I mean by this is that everyone will get something different out of it.  Yes, there are times when you can get frustrated by perhaps not understanding something your partner is saying, or feeling like they are ahead of you, and to be able to admit your own faults to someone else can be nerve racking. This may cause some people to dread the entire experience altogether.  For me, since coming to DBC and learning to think according to a growth mindset, I feel like the toughest times are the most rewarding, and if you can learn and work through you are bound for success.</p>

<p>During one of my pairing sessions, my partner and I worked through a challenge and I found that there were things we were both learning from each other. It is pairing like these that are most memorable because not only are you getting the pleasure of learning something new or even a different perspective, but also you get to solidify your own learning by teaching someone else your way.</p>

<p>Once a pairing session is done, it is time to reflect and to give back to your partner.  This is what we call feedback. Feedback is a key part of the whole process and really brings everything full circle.</p>

<p>I am often slightly uneasy about reading feedback because it is here that you are most vulnerable to the opinions of others, and it can sometimes hurt your ego.  It is a chance to see yourself through the eyes of another, and maybe that concept you understood so well isn’t so well understood after all. Feedback is a great opportunity to reexamine your self. This is why kind and actionable is so important.</p>

<p>Writing feedback can be described as easy and hard. I would say it is easy to praise others for a job well done, but can be difficult to be objective. We have this built in fear of hurting others and it often leads us to soften our feedback. I am really working on making my feedback honest because the real hurt comes from not being truthful. Feedback that may be direct and honest might make someone put that into action right away. I am really a nonbeliever of the “good job” feedback. It is our chance to lay it all out there and offer our ideas on how others can improve!</p>
