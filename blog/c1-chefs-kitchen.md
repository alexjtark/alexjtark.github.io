# My DevBootcamp Cultural Blog
#### Phase 0 week 1

My take on the DBC experience is that you have a lot of say in your own learning and development. DBC is unlike the traditional learning system in which there is a rigid curriculum. I feel that if I have some positive input or perhaps a different way of doing something, my feedback will be heard, appreciated, and makes an impact to the evolution of the program.

I see myself being not only in the role of the student, but also a trailblazer. I am now more aware of my responsibilities of being a student at DBC.  I am not here at DBC to only take, but I to also give back.  I am aware that the developer culture thrives on teamwork as we are all adding to a pool of shared knowledge and experiences. We are all unique individuals with slightly different lenses on how to view the world and how to solve problems, so everyone’s opinion and input should be listened to and valued.  I know that there will be times where I feel like I am the least developed person in the room, but if I keep the communal aspect of sharing and kindness in mind, then my vulnerabilities will turn into strengths: the strength of honesty and asking questions immediately, and not being afraid to do so. I will also keep in mind when I see someone who needs help and I can help, I will offer myself to help him or her in return.

Upon watching this fireside chat, my expectations of DBC have changed in a sense that I now feel a sense of duty to myself and to DBC, because as much sacrifice I am making in my personal life and having a blind faith in the DBC program, they are taking a chance on me in return in the hope that I represent their culture as well. I am aware that I was selected as a student for a reason, and it inspires me to know that I will be around many motivated individuals. So here I am, looking at all of the chefs in the kitchen, I am now here with my apron, fresh out of the bag and an unused potato peeler in hand ready and eager to learn and contribute to this delicious meal called Dev Bootcamp!

I am very excited to take part in this program. I will take control of my education.  I will commit fully to the program. I will listen and I will give feedback.

Am I nervous? Absolutely!  As Shareef mentioned early in the video, the North American educational mindset is geared towards never revealing or weaknesses or admitting we do not know. In a sense, this becomes ingrained in us and letting go of this gives me a queasy feeling in my stomach. We are going to be re-wiring out brains and giving into this new mindset with total faith.  I am nervous that I may not know too much about programming, but I am hopeful with the idea that the code is actually a small portion of the process, and what we are actually here to learn in the logic behind being a programmer.

Nervousness, excitement, hunger, drive and passion are all words that describe my feelings at present. I’m here to become my dreams.

Thank you for reading.
