<h6><big> Asking Good Questions</big></h6>

<p>I have a question for you. Have you ever asked a question that simply questions your questioning? I know I have!  When I started my journey into development, I had all this information that I wanted, but my problem lied in the fact that I didn’t know how to ask. I once asked a question on stack overflow that got -5’d as fast as I posted it. Here I was keen on knowing more, proud to put myself out there and I got feedback of being too vague! Nonetheless, I can say that I learned quite a bit from that point and I can admit that yes, especially in the development world, asking vague questions does no good for anyone.  </p>
<p>I wanted to share this story because, like many, I’m sure when we are getting ourselves into a new role/career/community, we are not familiar with the “rules”. I mean this loosely but what it means is that being a good question asker takes effort and practice. We have to be able to look at something and really drill down the exact thing we want answered.  </p>
<p>I believe a good question in development looks something like this. 1) It points to a specific problem in the code. Something to the point of “I am receiving an argument error on line 15…” as opposed to “Why isn’t my code working?” 2) It shows that thought has been put into it. People can appreciate the work you put into trying to get the answer and it may help them from steering off into a futile path. 3) It asks for a relatively specific resolve. You want to let the people you are asking know what it is you are looking to have that code accomplish.  Now that I have listed what I find helps me write a good question, lets put it all together write one! </p>
<p>“I am having trouble with my nested arrays. I am looking to pop and sort the requested data into a new array but I have had trouble doing so. I have broken down the problem to be on line 25 of my code. I have tried the pop method but it creates multiple new arrays. Any feedback is appreciated.” </p>
<p>I hope this helps and keep asking questions!  </p>
