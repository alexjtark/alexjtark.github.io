<p> Hello again! This week I will be examining the differences between arrays and hashes!
</p>

<p>To begin lets get a little into what exactly arrays and hashes are. An array is essentially a list that holds a collection of objects. These can be strings and/or numbers for example.An example of an array would look like so:</a>

<p> array("pencil","pen", "44", "apple")</p>

<p> If we want to call an item from an array we would have to do so based on its index value. For this, we always begin at 0. So if we wanted the pencil, we would have to do array(0).</p>

<p>Hashes on the other hand, work in sort of the opposite way in that we call the item istelf and it returns whatever we associate it with. A hash looks like this:</p>

<p>city = {"Toronto" => Canada, "New York" => USA} </p>

  <p>So, for instance, if we now called on the has New York, it would return USA.</p>

  <p> To summarize, arrays work like indexed lists, they can be organized, arranged, and values can be pulled out using a defined number. Hashes work like lists as well, but are assigned based on their key values.</p>

  <p> Thank you for reading!</p>
