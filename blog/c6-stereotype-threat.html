<span style="position: relative; top: -150px;"><h2> Stereotype Threat</h2>

  <p>Stereotype threat is described as an outside influence over one’s achievement. Studies have been conducted to confirm this, and some examples included academic performance with different ethnic groups. </p>

  <p>What stereotype threat is outlining is that when someone is reminded of their race, for example, they tend to perform based on that groups stereotype. In my research, I read an example of women that tended to underperform in entrepreneurialism compared to men because there is a strong stereotype that this is a man’s profession. </p>

  <p> I believe that the fact that people slip into these beliefs in an automatic way, not knowing they are actually behaving according to these outside influences in the major concern.</p>

  <p> I can appreciate this study having a university background in sociology. I understand the power symbols and hegemony can have on the achievement of individuals and groups as a whole.   I believe that everyone has encountered some form on stereotype threat at some point in ones life. It is an almost automatic reaction because the mind tends to not want to be “different”, so it relies on convention. We have a natural fear of being different or not average, so when stereotype threat is encountered it is easier of safer to hide behind it as a screen and if you perform according to it you have an easy excuse being that you performed as expected.</p>

  <p> I believe we can all influence a positive environment to reduce stereotype threat but I do not think it is realistic to eliminate it altogether. We can certainly reduce it by giving everyone fair treatment by making everyone feel included and valued, but there is an aspect of stereotype threat that is internal and therefore is controlled, consciously or not by ones internal experiences.</p>
