<p> As you can see from my title, I will be discussing the skill shortage within the tech industry today.
</p>

<p>Since the literal explosion of the mobile phone market, apps have never been bigger. These markets are only expected to grow.  Online shopping, and the use of the Internet in general is growing.  Behind these technologies is a group of people that actually have to sit there and build them. These people are called developers!</p>

<p>Software development is one of the top five most in demand jobs globally, yet there are less than half of the required people available to fill these roles.  The story only gets better for software developers, who enjoy a healthy national average salary above 90k, compared to an average of around 48k for all jobs. The pay is great and employers are literally waiting for people to come in and fill their seats. Mircosoft’s former CEO Steve Ballmer is famously known for chanting “developers! developers! developers! developers!”</p>

<p>So we must ask ourselves, “Where the heck are the developers?!” I truly believe this is one of the biggest opportunities in the world for people wanting to get into this field. Companies and even governments have had to get on board with trying to fix this looming employment shortage. </p>

<p>The major issue that if effecting the solution to getting more people into software development is, I believe, based on perception and passion. What I mean by this is that perceptually speaking, the majority of people believe that programming is a high level career, one that which only few people could ever achieve because so few can comprehend the knowledge needed. This goes right back to the fear of the unknown. If someone has no idea about something, they usually resort to the idea that it is unknown for a reason. </p>

<p> The other side of this is passion. As much as people enjoy fiddling with their phones, using their favorite apps and going on their favorite sites, there just isn’t a much emphasis put on being able to create and much as there is consuming. The majority of people are happy being on the consumer end. </p>

<p>I believe a long-term solution to the tech labor shortage is exposure. As many people have to be exposed to what exactly programming is as early as possible. Yes, it is a lucrative career and yes it is a career with many opportunities but the major gap that needs to be filled here is what exactly programming is. People need to be given realization that the only reason our progress and innovation isn’t any faster is due to not enough people driving it. There are plenty of seats!</p>

  <p> What are you thoughts on this?</p>
