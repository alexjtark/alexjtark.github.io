<h3> September 21, 2014</h3>

<p>Hello all readers and thank you for taking the time to read my technical blog on my journey through DevBootcamp. I have just gone and completed my first week of the off site learning, better known as phase 0. I found this weeks material challenging, a little nerve racking and most of all opened my eyes to many new concepts which leaves me with optimism and excitement.

  <br>

Some of the topics I have learned this week pertain to git and GitHub. I will go on to explain my learning thus far.

<br>

This week we learned all about version control. In brief, version control is the ability to store and record all changes made to a project, while keeping all versions of the files. One can easily view and revert back to any version. There are some amazing benefits to this with regards to coding. For example, if I were building a site without version control and I discovered a bug, I would have to spend my time going through the entire code, and possibly causing even more damage. With version control however, I can keep track of the changes I have made, log what change was made in each version, and if I have to go into debugging, I know there is a working copy in a previous version ready just incase I cause damage.

<br>

So, how does git keep track of changes you ask? Git keeps a log of each version that you have committed. These versions are stored and can be brought up by examining the version log. I must not that it is important to keep your log messages clear and concise. You must know exactly what you did to update each version or it defeats the purpose of logging versions. This is especially important when collaborating with team members.

<br>

GitHub is a great place to store your version updates remotely. The site will keep a repository, repo for short, of your files and all of the versions. What is beautiful about having an online storage place for your projects is that you are able to work with team members much easier on coding projects. Everyone has access to the repo and can clone a copy for themselves to begin working on. GitHub is also a social site, so if you decide to allow others to see your code, perhaps in an open source licensing environment, you are able to get feedback and collaboration from many of the site members, allowing for greater efficiency and shared knowledge.

<br>

I look forward to week 2 and I hope you have enjoyed my post!
