<span style="position: relative; top: -150px;"><h2> Values</h2>

  <p>Hello, this week’s blog centers on values. When I think of values, some words the come to me are introspection, persistence, honesty and health. I have chosen introspection.  This word means doing self-analysis and looking within your self at your strengths and opportunities. I feel that I am well in tune with myself and can understand opportunities for learning and change.  I deeply value the need to take a step back and let yourself work out the world around you.</p>

  <p>This is how I live up to these values from 1 to 5:
Introspection: 4. I try to give myself regular time to meditate and reflect.
Persistence: 3.  I believe that this are is my weakest of all values but I am proving to myself more each day as to the power of persistence. I find that sticking to something difficult (like DBC!) is far more rewarding than packing it in and saying you gave it your best try.
Honesty: 4. I truly believe in being honest in all situations and although it sometimes hurts, it is unavoidable. I gave this a 4 because I feel like there is always going to be a time when your guard is up and you can’t admit to something at that moment.
Health: 5. I put a lot of value into health and wellness. It is one aspect that if we do not possess, we simply do not live the quality of life we want or deserve.
</p>

<p>The last topic I was asked to give advice on was with regards to career. I had a great discussion with a younger coworker about careers, as she was aware of my big change to come to DBC. She had mentioned to me how envious she was of me doing this in terms of pursuing my passions. She let me know she was left confused as to which direction to head. I offered one little piece of advice: Do what you would regret not doing the most. I have found that to work out for me and I was happy to share it.</p>

<p>I feel that my values can work toward alleviating stereotype threat.  I feel that persistence of change can help with this.  I also find that the value of introspection can help with this as knowing oneself plays a large role in stereotype threat. I know that taking time to reflect works for me when I come across a tough situation, and being able to know yourself helps you identify those times.</p>
