<span style="position: relative; top: -150px;"><h2> Blocks Procs and Lambdas</h2>

  <p> For this week’s technical blog, I decided to tackle a subject that I myself needed a lot of training on. I found that through my learning of blocks, procs and lambdas, a lot was cleared up and I would like to share that with you, my reader. Lets start with blocks</p>

  <p> Blocks </p>

  <p> It can be a little confusing that in a language like Ruby where we are told that everything is an object comes along learning about blocks which ARE NOT OBJECTS!</p>

  <p> A block is essentially a block of code in between do and end. Blocks have a special key word “yield” attached to its calling. When we call a block, we are only ever using it in that instance. Blocks cannot be saved or called outside of it function.</p>

  <p> Procs</p>

  <p>A proc is an anonymous function that can be represented as an object. A proc, short for procedure, is something we explicitly define and can call again later on in the code. Its state is saved. In order for a proc to work, it must also have a block or it will look for a block to attach itself to. The proc object will run whether or not we call an argument.</p>


  <p>Lambdas </p>

  <p>Lambdas are essentially procs but with slightly different behaviors. Lambdas check for number of arguments, as procs do not. It will act like a method in which you will receive an argument error if they do not equal eachother.</p>

  <p> I hope this cleared some information up about blocks, procs and lambdas!</p>
