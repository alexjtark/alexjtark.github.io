<p>Hello again!</p>

<p>This week I want to introduce you to the differences between positioning with stylistic elements within your html page. The positions of fixed, absolute and relative.</p>

<p>A fixed element is one that will not move at all on a page. That means that even if you scroll, the element will simply not move. This may be useful for displaying some very important information that you never want to leave the userâ€™s eyes.</p>

<p>An absolute position is one that will stay in a given position on a page. It differs from the fixed position because in this case, the element will in fact scroll. Think of an absolute position as being tied to a certain line on a page. You may scroll away from the line, and that element will forever sit there.</p>

<p>Finally, a relative position is relative to other elements. This means that it will account for where it is in a page and will be placed according to that.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and until next time!</p>
