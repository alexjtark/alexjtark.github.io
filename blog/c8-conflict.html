<h6><big> Cultural Blog: Conflict</big></h6>


  <p>Hello, Thank you for checking out my blog about conflict and the wheel on shame. To quickly summarize, the wheel of shame is a concept derived by Dr. L Nathanson and it deals with how we approach with shame in situations in which we lose our emotional control over. The poles on this compass are avoidance, withdrawal, attack self, and attack other. </p>
  <p>As mentioned, no one can have complete control over their emotions at all times, and in doing so confront a situation with one or more of these compass directions at a certain point in their lives.  </p>
  <p>I can recall a recent emotional conflict in which I was confronted with this compass.  I had a conflict with a family member over my stress level at work. This person noticed by behavior becoming more distant at home, as I was beginning to hide my feelings by withdrawing. When I was asked about the situation I began to get angry.  This anger only pushed us apart, and instead of having someone looking to help, I had someone else angry at me due to my handling of that situation. After things cooled down, I was able to discuss my problems that in fact I was handling a very heavy workload that was taking over my personal time and that I should let my manager know so that I could get the proper help. After I let this out, I immediately felt a sense of happiness that I could let someone else know my feelings.  </p>
  <p> The point of this little story is that after learning a little more about the compass of shame, I was able to look back and understand the root cause of my stress and that if I could go back and replay that scenario, I would have gone directly to my manager at the very point I felt like I was getting overwhelmed. I believe that we may not be able to immediately see the better course of action to take, but with reflection we can better understand our typical patterns and consciously work out of how steer our programmed path to a different and better direction.</p>
