<p>Hello, today I am going to get you more acquainted with Rails. I know you may have heard the term Ruby on Rails at some point, and most of us can safely deduce that Ruby is a programming language, but why the “on Rails” part? </p>
<p>Today is your lucky day as I am going to do my best to explain that to you my reader!  Ruby on Rails, or Rails as it is commonly called, is an open source web framework used to build web applications. It was developed by David Heinemeier Hansson. The framework is built on the Ruby language. It is considered an opinionated framework because it has a set of conventions that it tries to apply to code when writing it. It aims to create a more productive programming environment. </p>
<p>Some interesting conventions Rails follows are DRY (Do not repeat yourself) and Convention over Configuration.  The DRY principle basically outlines that each line of code has its own purpose and is not needlessly repeated throughout the application. The Convention principle helps establish a best practice way of doing things so that the developer does not have to spend time thinking about this, such as naming conventions; names automatically generated for you as opposed to having to think them out. </p>
<p>Rails also uses what is called a Model View Controller. Essentially this separates out the functions of views, which is the layouts or what the user sees, controls, which are what the user would manipulate, and models, which are mainly database items, into neatly packaged areas so that it is easier to go back and review or make changes later on. </p>
<p>As you can see, Rails does its best to organize, name and store code in a way that allows the developer to be more productive in hopes of saving time and making better decisions. I am excited to give Rails a go and report on my experiences. </p>
