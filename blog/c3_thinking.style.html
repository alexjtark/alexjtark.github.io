<p> So I am not officially 3 weeks into my DBC experience. Looking back on what I have completed and learned so far is amazing thus far. I can now do things with a relative ease that I had never even knew of prior: building a basic site from scratch, making it look pretty without having to look for templates, using GitHub and actually opening that little known application on a computer known as <em>terminal</em>.  All of this has come with some sacrifice and a lot of focus.</p>

<p>My biggest struggle up to this point has easily been organizing my free time to properly complete the DBC curriculum. I have found working a full time job, with the added 2 hours a day of travel has taken a toll on me. I am glad to be fully focused on DBC very shortly but for now it is the circumstance I face.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks of DBC and looking at my Gregorc learning style I can see some things within myself.  I have been diagnosed a Concrete Random thinker. These are my traits:</p>

<h4>This learner likes:</h4>
<p>experimenting to find answers</p>
<p>take risks</p>
<p>use their intuition</p>
<p>solving problems independently</p>
<p>They learn best when:</p>
<p>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</p>
<p>able to compete with others</p>
<p>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</p>

<h4>What's hard for them?</h4>
<p>Restrictions and limitations</p>
<p>Formal reports</p>
<p>Routines</p>
<p>Re-doing anything once itâ€™s done</p>
<p>Keeping detailed records</p>
<p>Showing how they got an answer</p>
<p>Choosing only one answer</p>
<p>Having no options</p>

<p>It is actually very interesting to see how much of this is true to me. I have had trouble in the past with a routine and this is why I have had to challenge myself a great deal to keep on my learning path considering my reduced amount of time I have to spend on the curriculum.  Some other glaring ones I notice are my trial and error approach to problems and experimentation. I find the independent problem solving approach somewhat interpretive however, because I take it in the way that I can construct an answer, share it with my team members, re-evaluate and come up with a better solution. Learning is a constant evolution and I enjoyed looking back on my learning style.</p>

<p>When I look back on the fixed vs growth mindset, I can now see that this is a moving scale that shifts depending on my mood, time of day and complexity of work. I would like to believe it is an achievement to break through the fixed mindset when approaching a challenge. For example, I had some difficulty with the curriculum of week 2, and I found myself wanting to not focus on the challenges. I did however catch myself, and I pushed even harder to get through the work.  I really do believe the most rewarding things in life are usually the most difficult because most people are not able to achieve them or they are not focused enough to do so. That is why I am constantly challenging myself and reminding myself that becoming a programmer will be one of the most rewarding things in my life.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have been making changes to the way I am approaching challenges, focusing on challenges and ensuring I give my complete effort. I am aware of my challenges of time and working trough difficult situations and I enjoy the challenge! I believe that we adapt to our environments and if my environment is one of  constant challenge then I will adapt and succeed.
